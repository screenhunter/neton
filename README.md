Spotify Organizer

Given a user, we want to look through all of their Liked Songs and list what playlists they are in. We also want to print out a list of songs not in any playlist.

Input: user_id as a command line argument
Output: 2 Textfiles. Organized.txt should contain lines in the form (<Song Name>, [<Playlist1>, <Playlist2>, ...]). Unorganized.txt should just list all the songs without a playlist on separate lines.
